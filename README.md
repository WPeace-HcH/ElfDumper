## Background
When I use the IDA to dump a ELF file, I don't have any plugin that can dump easily. So I write this plugin for IDA.
## Install
- Just copy the file `ElfDumper.py` and the folder `ElfDumper_WPeace` to IDA Plugins folder, then restart IDA Pro to use ElfDumper.  
- `NOTE`: You need python3 and IDA >= 7.4.
## Usage
You just need to give it a hex address and then it will dump the ELF file easily.
